## What is RUIL?

RUIL is a small library of around 30 graphic components in SVG format for module developers on VCV Rack, the open source modular synthesizer.

At this point, the components are very rough, so there are no code labels or any kind of programming functionality, just very bare-bones graphics, but the plan is to release improved versions with the time, and of course, with your collaboration.

There will be more components added in the upcoming weeks. Please feel free to submit any ideas of improvements.
